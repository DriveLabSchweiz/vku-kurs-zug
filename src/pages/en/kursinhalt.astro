    title: "Traffic Vision",
    text: "In the first module 'Traffic Vision' we sharpen your perception. You learn how the human eye works in traffic and where its limits are. We train scanning techniques so that you recognize dangers early. An important part is the correct estimation of speeds and distances, which is crucial especially when overtaking or turning. Typical mistakes like 'tunnel vision' are analyzed and avoided.",
  },
  {
    title: "Traffic Environment",
    text: "The module 'Traffic Environment' deals with external influences. How do you behave in rain, snow, or fog? How do you interact with other road users like pedestrians, cyclists, or heavy trucks? We use 360-degree videos from Zug to show you real situations. You learn to drive cooperatively and interpret the intentions of others early on.",
  },
  {
    title: "Traffic Dynamics",
    text: "This is about the physics of driving. What happens when braking? How do centrifugal forces act in curves? We discuss load securing and the influence of vehicle condition on safety. Modern assistance systems (ABS, ESP, lane keeping assist) are also explained – whether you drive a Tesla or a combustion engine. You understand why physical laws are non-negotiable.",
  },
  {
    title: "Traffic Tactics",
    text: "In the last module 'Traffic Tactics' it's about your driving ability. Fatigue, alcohol, medication, and distraction (e.g., by mobile phone) are major risk factors. We develop strategies on how to stay fit and concentrated. We also address environmentally aware driving (Eco-Drive) so that you are not only safe but also economical on the road. Your way to becoming a responsible driver.",
